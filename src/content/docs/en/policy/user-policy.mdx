AxylOS does not have an official User Policy as a separate document. However, as a user of AxylOS, it is important to follow certain guidelines and best practices to ensure a positive and respectful experience within the Linux community. These guidelines can be found in various resources provided by the AxylOS, Arch Linux and Nix communities.

Please note that, as an open-source community-driven project, the guidelines and practices may evolve over time. It is always a good idea to stay up-to-date with the latest documentation and community resources to ensure compliance with the community's expectations and standards.
