AxylOS is a community-driven project that focuses on providing a lightweight and customizable Linux distribution.

AxylOS does not collect personal information about users by default. However, it's important to note that, when you use AxylOS, you may install various software packages, tools, or applications that have their own privacy policies. These policies are specific to the respective software and not directly related to AxylOS itself.

When installing software on AxylOS, it's crucial to review the privacy policies of individual applications or services that you use or interact with. This is especially important for any third-party applications or services you install on top of the AxylOS distribution.
