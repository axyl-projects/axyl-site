Try also to give a look to the [Troubleshooting](/en/support/troubleshooting/) document or among the [opened](https://github.com/AxylOS-OS/AxylOS/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) or [closed issue tickets](https://github.com/AxylOS-OS/AxylOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to search for any solution in case it has been already reported by another user.
