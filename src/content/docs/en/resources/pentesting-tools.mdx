AxylOS hacking tool surface mainly leverages on AxylOS and Nixpkgs repositories.

[AxylOS repository](https://github.com/AxylOS-OS/AxylOS) is an Arch-based Linux repository started as a fork of [BlackArch repository](https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch/). Its repository contains 2800+ tools, classified for categories. You can install tools individually or in groups according to the categories they belong. AxylOS repository is compatible with all Arch-based distributions.

[Nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) is the official Nix repository containing also all the pentesting tools deployed by the community.

Hacking tools can be installed and used in several ways by:
* Single tools
* Cyber Security roles
* Red Team menu
* Categories

### Single tools

For installing a single tool, in AxylOS Arch you can simply run `sudo pacman -S <tool-name>` while in AxylOS Nix you can simply declare it inside `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` or run it in an ephimeral environment by `nix-shell -p <tool-name>`.

### Cyber Security roles

Cyber Security roles allow to install hacking tools according to a specific role. Each one of these roles is linked to a package that is installed according to the following table:

| Role | Command |
| ---- | ------- |
| üíô Blue Teamer üíô | cyber-toolkit blue |
| üêû Bug Bounty Hunter üêû | cyber-toolkit bugbounty |
| üçò Cracker Specialist üçò | cyber-toolkit cracker |
| üíÄ DoS Tester üíÄ | cyber-toolkit dos |
| üéì Enthusiast Student üéì | cyber-toolkit student |
| üîç Forensic Analyst üîç | cyber-toolkit forensic |
| ü¶† Malware Analyst ü¶† | cyber-toolkit malware |
| üì± Mobile Analyst üì± | cyber-toolkit mobile |
| üåê Network Analyst üåê | cyber-toolkit network |
| üïµÔ∏è OSINT Specialist üïµÔ∏è | cyber-toolkit osint |
| ‚ù§Ô∏è Red Teamer ‚ù§Ô∏è | cyber-toolkit red |
| üï∏Ô∏è Web Pentester üï∏Ô∏è | cyber-toolkit web |

:::note
`cyber-toolkit` needs `sudo` to run.

In AxylOS Arch, if you wish to know what are the tools for each role, you can use two methods:
1. opening **AxylOS Welcome** and click on **Show Tools for Roles** button
   * you can filter the roles by the button on the bottom side
     ![AxylOS Welcome Role Tools](@assets/images/AxylOS-welcome-roletools.png)
2. running `pacman -Sii <role-package> | grep -Po '^Depends On\s*: \K.+' | head -1`
   * where `<role-package>` should be replaced by the package of a role, for example `AxylOS-redteamer`.

In AxylOS Nix, these roles are deployed by `/etc/nixos/modules/cyber` module and the user can customize it as desired.

Inside the role module files, the user can see what are the specific tools installed for each role.

You can set your Cyber Security role as described [here](/en/resources/AxylOS-welcome/#cyber-security-roles).

In AxylOS Arch, you can set more than one role, AxylOS Welcome will keep the latest set role. During the download of packages for a role, in case the process is interrupted, don't worry, you don't need to download from scratch because the downloaded packages are temporarily saved in pacman cache.

In AxylOS Nix, to set more than one role, it is needed to manually edit `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and add a further line invoking the second role Nix module.

### Red Team menu

AxylOS GNOME uses Red Team menu for accessing to the main hacking tools. It is better described in detail [here](/en/resources/redteam-menu/).

### Issues

In AxylOS Nix, during the installation of a role, if you get an error that interrupts the process, detect what is the tool package is producing the error, edit `/etc/nixos/modules/roles/<your-role>/default.nix` and comment or delete the line containing the tool package name and reinstall the role.
